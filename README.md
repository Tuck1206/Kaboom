# Kaboom
is a interactive game were the object of the game is to try to not blow up!(hence the name Kaboom)
players take turns choosing circles in hope of becoming the last one standing.
Once a circle is chosen, the circle will change color indacating that the space is now off limits. (no double usage of the same circle)
Both players continue to pick circles until one player choses the bomb (kaboom)
The player who dosen't chose the bomb (Kaboom) is the winner and the player who choses the bomb (Kaboom) has lost the game.
Upon reset, all circles will regain its orginal color and all circles will be avaiable again.
Also upon reset, the bombs will change circles so there will be more of a challenge and unpreditability and not just memory!
